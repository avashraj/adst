adst get car crashes

We save the string car crashes as that is our input and we query Data.gov and Kaggle

On each site, we expect to have a list of results ranked in some fashion. For now we just grab the top two results from each site

If no results pop up on both sites, we communicate this to the user.

We display the four options to the user and they can select one.

For the option they select, we scrape that site and download the appropriate dataset

Communicate that the data is downloading.

While the data is downloading, in parallel we can grab the important keywords from the dataset they chose.

We can query Wikipedia with those keywords and download the html from those articles.

We construct one long document of text with the information from those articles and we ask an llm to write a summary for those.

Create a new directory and move the data to the new directory

Create another directory and move wikipedia articles and llm generated summary to the directory

Done
