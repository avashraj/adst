Adst is a commnand line tool where the user can enter a topic they would like to research about and get options for datasets from data.gov and kaggle as well as accompanying summaries
of relevant information needed to analyze the data from Wikipedia. The user can pick one of the datasets provided and they will find two directories created in their current directory.
The first, data, will have the data from their dataset in the file format of their choice. The second, background, will have Wikipedia articles as well as a llm generated summary from
the scraped summaries.

I want to build this project because I am interested in learning more Go and understanding how web scrapers work.
